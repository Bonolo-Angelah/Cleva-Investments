         Adding Logo to Cleva Investment Presentation
================================================================================

STEP 1: SAVE YOUR LOGO IMAGE
-----------------------------
You already provided the Gijima logo image. Now you need to save it:

1. Locate the Gijima logo image you showed me (the one with navy blue
   text and three red dots)

2. Right-click on the image

3. Select "Save Image As..." or "Save Picture As..."

4. Save it with this EXACT name: gijima-logo.png

5. Save it to this EXACT location:
   c:\Users\dikonketso.ndumndum\cleva-investment\docs\gijima-logo.png


STEP 2: VERIFY THE FILE
------------------------
Open File Explorer and navigate to:
   c:\Users\dikonketso.ndumndum\cleva-investment\docs\

You should see:
   ✓ gijima-logo.png (your logo file)
   ✓ generate_presentation.py (the script)
   ✓ Cleva_Investment_Presentation.pptx (current presentation)

STEP 4: VERIFY LOGO IN PRESENTATION
------------------------------------

2. Check the bottom-right corner of each slide
3. You should see the Gijima logo on every slide!

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
Problem: "Logo not appearing"
Solution:
  - Make sure filename is exactly: gijima-logo.png (lowercase)
  - Make sure it's in the docs folder
  - Try using .png format (not .jpg)

Problem: "File not found error"
Solution:
  - Check the file path carefully
  - Make sure there are no extra spaces in filename

Problem: "Logo looks stretched"
Solution:
  - Use a high-resolution PNG image
  - Recommended: 300-400px width minimum

================================================================================
                         READY TO GO!
================================================================================
